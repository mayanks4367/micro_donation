# 🌟 MicroDonate: Blockchain-Powered Micro-Donations

**Transparent | Efficient | Decentralized**

---

## 🎯 **Purpose**  
MicroDonate is a smart contract-based platform enabling **trustless, low-cost micro-donations in ETH**, designed to revolutionize charitable giving by leveraging blockchain technology. Cut out intermediaries and empower donors/charities with direct, auditable transactions.

---

## 🔥 **Problem Solved**  
Traditional donation platforms suffer from:  
- High transaction fees (3-10%)  
- Opaque fund tracking  
- Minimum donation limits  
- Slow settlement times  

MicroDonate addresses these with:  
- **Sub-1% fees** (configurable)  
- **Real-time on-chain transparency**  
- **0.001 ETH minimum donations**  
- **Instant ETH transfers**  

---

## 🚀 **Key Innovations**  
- 💸 **Dynamic Fee Engine**: Set platform fees (0-10%) via basis points  
- 📊 **Donor Leaderboards**: Track contributions via public mappings  
- 🔒 **Self-Custody**: Charities control funds directly (no escrow)  
- ⚡ **Gas Optimization**: 50k gas per donation (under $0.50*)  
  _*Based on 10 Gwei gas price_

---

## 🛠️ **Technical Core**  
- **Solidity 0.8**: Safe math by default, explicit visibility  
- **Hardhat Suite**: Testing, deployment, task automation  
- **EVM Compatibility**: Deploy on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.  
- **Security First**: Custom reentrancy guard + fee caps  

---

## 🎯 **Use Cases**
